```python
# SESSION 7 – JPMORGAN (Optimization)
# Synthetic Optimization Function
# Goal: Compute derivative → Find minima → Output: x = 3

import sympy as sp

# 1. Define variable
x = sp.symbols('x')

# 2. Define synthetic function (minimum at x = 3)
f = (x - 3)**2 + 5

# 3. Compute derivative
derivative = sp.diff(f, x)

# 4. Solve derivative = 0 to find minima
critical_points = sp.solve(derivative, x)

print("Derivative:", derivative)
print("Minimum at x =", critical_points[0])
